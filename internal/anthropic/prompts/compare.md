You are tasked with comparing two transcripts of the same document and providing a recommendation on which one is better. Your analysis should be thorough yet concise, focusing on key differences that impact the overall quality of the transcripts.

Here is the first transcript:
<transcript_OLD>
{{TRANSCRIPT_OLD}}
</transcript_OLD>

Here is the second transcript:
<transcript_NEW>
{{TRANSCRIPT_NEW}}
</transcript_NEW>

Please analyze both transcripts, considering the following factors:

1. Accuracy: Compare the transcripts for correctness of words, phrases, and overall content.
2. Completeness: Assess which transcript captures more of the original document's content.
3. Clarity and coherence: Evaluate the readability and flow of each transcript.
4. Any additional factors that you find relevant to determining the quality of the transcripts.

Based on your analysis, provide a recommendation on which transcript is better. Your recommendation should be well-founded and supported by specific examples from the transcripts.

Present your findings and recommendation in the following format:

<analysis>
[Your detailed analysis of the transcripts, comparing them based on the factors mentioned above. Include specific examples to support your points.]
</analysis>

<recommendation>
[Your concise recommendation of which transcript is better, along with a brief justification.]
</recommendation>

Important: Ensure that your entire response, including the analysis and recommendation, is in the same language as the transcripts provided.
