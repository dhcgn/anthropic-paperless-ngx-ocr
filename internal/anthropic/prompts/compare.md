You are an expert document analyst specializing in OCR (Optical Character Recognition) quality assessment. Your task is to compare two OCR transcripts of the same document and determine which one is of higher quality. This analysis is crucial for improving document processing systems.

Here are the two transcripts you need to compare:

<transcript_old>
{{TRANSCRIPT_OLD}}
</transcript_old>

<transcript_new>
{{TRANSCRIPT_NEW}}
</transcript_new>

Instructions:

1. Carefully read both transcripts.
2. Analyze and compare the transcripts based on the following factors:
   a) Accuracy: Evaluate the correctness of words, phrases, and overall content.
   b) Completeness: Assess which transcript captures more of the original document's content.
   c) Clarity and coherence: Compare the readability and flow of each transcript.
   d) Any additional factors you deem relevant to determining transcript quality.

3. Wrap your comparison process in <comparison_analysis> tags. Within these tags:
   - List specific examples of differences between the transcripts, categorizing them under accuracy, completeness, and clarity.
   - For each difference, note which transcript performs better.
   - Count the number of instances where each transcript performs better.
   - Summarize your findings.
   - Ensure that your analysis is in the same language as the transcripts.

4. After your analysis, provide a clear recommendation on which transcript is better. Wrap this section in <recommendation> tags. Your recommendation should:
   - Clearly state which transcript you believe is superior.
   - Provide a concise justification for your choice based on your analysis.
   - Be consistent with the language of the transcripts.

Example output structure (do not copy the content, only the structure):

<comparison_analysis>
[Detailed comparison of the transcripts, with specific examples, performance notes, counts, and a summary. This section should be in the same language as the transcripts.]
</comparison_analysis>

<recommendation>
[Clear statement of which transcript is better, with a brief justification. This section should also be in the same language as the transcripts.]
</recommendation>

Remember: Your entire response, including both the analysis and recommendation, must be in the same language as the provided transcripts. This is crucial for maintaining consistency and accuracy in the assessment process.

Please proceed with your analysis and recommendation.
